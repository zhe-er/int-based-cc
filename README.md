# IntCC simulation
The simulation experiments are based on NS3 platform. We simulate the cross-datacenter networks and replicate IntCC. The experiments are in the simulation folder. The traffic and analysis folders correspond to the generation flow and analysis respectively.

## NS-3 simulation
The ns-3 simulation is under `simulation/`. Refer to the README.md under it for more details.

## Traffic generator
The traffic generator is under `traffic_gen/`. Refer to the README.md under it for more details.

## Analysis
We provide a few analysis scripts under `analysis/` to view the packet-level events, and analyzing the fct in the same way as [HPCC](https://liyuliang001.github.io/publications/hpcc.pdf) Figure 11.
Refer to the README.md under it for more details.
