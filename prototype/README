experiments
============

emulation experiments:
probebw : the mechanism of updating bottleneck bandwidth
probertt : the mechanism of updating base RTT

local servers:
background : background flows are on-off trace-based flows
load_3 : the background flows with the load of 0.3
on_off : the background flows are on and off 
avg_load3_onoff : obtain the queue length and utilization ratio of the first two experiments
fairness : compare IntCC with the other four algotihms
iperf : measure the overhead and delay

cloud servers:
cloud : use the Ali cloud servers to conduct experiments

doc : setup shows the network environments of these experiments
